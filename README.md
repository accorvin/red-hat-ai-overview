This is content shared with NC State pre-college students at Red Hat on the
topic of "An Overview of AI".

In this presentation I aim to:
  * Give attendees a glance into interesting applications for AI that exist today
  * Show attendees how machine learning models are created through a simple example
  * Introduce some career options that exist in the field of AI

This repository includes the materials shared in the presentation for future reference.
